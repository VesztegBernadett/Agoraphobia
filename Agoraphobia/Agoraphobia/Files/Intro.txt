John Merta, a writer known all around the globe, is currently suffering from writer's block. 
This leaves him panicking, for he is in great need of a new book, due to his nearness to bankruptcy.
After a long day full of effort, he defeatedly lays is head onto his pillow whilst his notebook lays empty atop his desk, with dozens of crumpled pages scattered on the floor.
However, no matter how hopeless he might feel, for a last ray of hope seems to shine upon him.
After finally falling asleep, he finds himself in a queer dream full of bizarre creatures and uncanny but exhilarating adventures... and, most importantly, numerous things to write about.
As his mind starts producing countless ideas, each better than the last, his wretchedness starts to fade away, replaced by a welcomed feeling of triumph.
For it is this strange dream that might help him prevail and come up with an idea worthy of his name... he needs only survive.
